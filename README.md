# OracleCommerceCRS-vagrantbox
Get up and running with Oracle Commerce 11 including CRS with one click installation

I am really excited about this!!! It's my effort to build a portable development environment with Oracle Commerce 11.

It is a work in progress. Feel free to download and use it (which will require manual installation at this point).

I will be highly grateful to your feedback and contributions. Join my mailing list <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/oraclecommercedev">OracleCommerceDev</a>
